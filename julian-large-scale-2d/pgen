#Cartesian CWB problem
#Note: To run using MPI, the MeshBlock size must be defined!
#Note: The user needs to set dfloor, pfloor and sfloor to sensible values.
#      In particular, dfloor should be set only about 5dex lower than the lowest expected density.
#      If it is set lower than this the hydro code can produce NaNs in the fluid values.
#
# For star2, at a distance of 1e16 cm, rho = 1.3e-23 g/cm^3. Therefore set dfloor=1e-25.
